%% OXFORD THESIS TEMPLATE

% Use this template to produce a standard thesis that meets the Oxford University requirements for DPhil submission

% John commented this file extensively, so read through to see how to use the various options.  Remember that in LaTeX,
% any line starting with a % is NOT executed.  Several places below, you have a choice of which line to use
% out of multiple options (eg draft vs final, for PDF vs for binding, etc.)  When you pick one, add a % to the beginning of
% the lines you don't want.


%%%%% PAGE LAYOUT
% The most common choices should be below.  You can also do other things, like replacing "a4paper" with "letterpaper", etc.

% This one formats for two-sided binding (ie left and right pages have mirror margins; blank pages inserted where needed):
%\documentclass[a4paper,twoside]{templates/ociamthesis}
% This one formats for one-sided binding (ie left margin > right margin; no extra blank pages):
%\documentclass[a4paper]{ociamthesis}
% This one formats for PDF output (ie equal margins, no extra blank pages):
%\documentclass[a4paper,nobind]{templates/ociamthesis}

% As you can see from the uncommented line below, oxforddown template uses the a4paper size, 
% and passes in the binding option from the YAML header in index.Rmd:
\documentclass[a4paper, nobind]{templates/ociamthesis}


%%%%% ADDING LATEX PACKAGES
% add hyperref package with options from YAML %
\usepackage[pdfpagelabels]{hyperref}
% change the default coloring of links to something sensible
\usepackage{xcolor}

\correctionstrue


%%%%% BIBLIOGRAPHY SETUP
% Note that your bibliography will require some tweaking depending on your department, preferred format, etc.
% If you've not used LaTeX before, I recommend reading a little about biblatex/biber and getting started with it.
% If you're already a LaTeX pro and are used to natbib or something, modify as necessary.
% Either way, you'll have to choose and configure an appropriate bibliography format...


\usepackage[style=authoryear, sorting=nyt, backend=biber, maxcitenames=2, useprefix, doi=true, isbn=false, uniquename=false]{biblatex}
\newcommand*{\bibtitle}{Works Cited}

\addbibresource{bibliography/references.bib}
\addbibresource{bibliography/additional-references.bib}


% This makes the bibliography left-aligned (not 'justified') and slightly smaller font.
\renewcommand*{\bibfont}{\raggedright\small}


% Uncomment this if you want equation numbers per section (2.3.12), instead of per chapter (2.18):
%\numberwithin{equation}{subsection}


%%%%% THESIS / TITLE PAGE INFORMATION
% Everybody needs to complete the following:
\title{My \texttt{FLAC3D} Notes}
\author{Kyeong Sun Kim}
\college{Civil and Environmental Engineering}

% Master's candidates who require the alternate title page (with candidate number and word count)
% must also un-comment and complete the following three lines:

% Uncomment the following line if your degree also includes exams (eg most masters):
%\renewcommand{\submittedtext}{Submitted in partial completion of the}
% Your full degree name.  (But remember that DPhils aren't "in" anything.  They're just DPhils.)
\degree{}
% Term and year of submission, or date if your board requires (eg most masters)
\degreedate{Sept, 2021}


%%%%% YOUR OWN PERSONAL MACROS
% This is a good place to dump your own LaTeX macros as they come up.

% To make text superscripts shortcuts
	\renewcommand{\th}{\textsuperscript{th}} % ex: I won 4\th place
	\newcommand{\nd}{\textsuperscript{nd}}
	\renewcommand{\st}{\textsuperscript{st}}
	\newcommand{\rd}{\textsuperscript{rd}}

%%%%% THE ACTUAL DOCUMENT STARTS HERE
\begin{document}

%%%%% CHOOSE YOUR LINE SPACING HERE
% This is the official option.  Use it for your submission copy and library copy:
\setlength{\textbaselineskip}{22pt plus2pt}
% This is closer spacing (about 1.5-spaced) that you might prefer for your personal copies:
%\setlength{\textbaselineskip}{18pt plus2pt minus1pt}

% You can set the spacing here for the roman-numbered pages (acknowledgements, table of contents, etc.)
\setlength{\frontmatterbaselineskip}{17pt plus1pt minus1pt}

% UL: You can set the line and paragraph spacing here for the separate abstract page to be handed in to Examination schools
\setlength{\abstractseparatelineskip}{13pt plus1pt minus1pt}
\setlength{\abstractseparateparskip}{0pt plus 1pt}

% UL: You can set the general paragraph spacing here - I've set it to 2pt (was 0) so
% it's less claustrophobic
\setlength{\parskip}{2pt plus 1pt}

%
% Oxford University logo on title page
%
\def\crest{{\includegraphics[width=5cm]{templates/snupdf.pdf}}}
\renewcommand{\university}{Seoul National University}
\renewcommand{\submittedtext}{}


% Leave this line alone; it gets things started for the real document.
\setlength{\baselineskip}{\textbaselineskip}


%%%%% CHOOSE YOUR SECTION NUMBERING DEPTH HERE
% You have two choices.  First, how far down are sections numbered?  (Below that, they're named but
% don't get numbers.)  Second, what level of section appears in the table of contents?  These don't have
% to match: you can have numbered sections that don't show up in the ToC, or unnumbered sections that
% do.  Throughout, 0 = chapter; 1 = section; 2 = subsection; 3 = subsubsection, 4 = paragraph...

% The level that gets a number:
\setcounter{secnumdepth}{3}
% The level that shows up in the ToC:
\setcounter{tocdepth}{2}


%%%%% ABSTRACT SEPARATE
% This is used to create the separate, one-page abstract that you are required to hand into the Exam
% Schools.  You can comment it out to generate a PDF for printing or whatnot.

% JEM: Pages are roman numbered from here, though page numbers are invisible until ToC.  This is in
% keeping with most typesetting conventions.
\begin{romanpages}

% Title page is created here
\maketitle

%%%%% DEDICATION -- If you'd like one, un-comment the following.

%%%%% ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS -- Nothing to do here except comment out if you don't want it.


%%%%% ABSTRACT -- Nothing to do here except comment out if you don't want it.
%\begin{abstract}
%	
%\end{abstract}

%%%%% MINI TABLES
% This lays the groundwork for per-chapter, mini tables of contents.  Comment the following line
% (and remove \minitoc from the chapter files) if you don't want this.  Un-comment either of the
% next two lines if you want a per-chapter list of figures or tables.
  \dominitoc % include a mini table of contents

% This aligns the bottom of the text of each page.  It generally makes things look better.
\flushbottom

% This is where the whole-document ToC appears:
\tableofcontents


% Uncomment to generate a list of tables:
%%%%% LIST OF ABBREVIATIONS
% This example includes a list of abbreviations.  Look at text/abbreviations.tex to see how that file is
% formatted.  The template can handle any kind of list though, so this might be a good place for a
% glossary, etc.

% The Roman pages, like the Roman Empire, must come to its inevitable close.
\end{romanpages}

%%%%% CHAPTERS
% Add or remove any chapters you'd like here, by file name (excluding '.tex'):
\flushbottom

% all your chapters and appendices will appear here
\minitoc

\subsection{Problem Statement}\label{problem-statement}}

The pile is subjected to an axial load of 100 kN,
and then the top of the pile is moved horizontally for a displacement of 4 cm.
The goal is to determine relation of axial loading to the ultimate bearing capacity.
And, lateral load-deflection curve is calculated.

  origin at the top of the pile, z upward.
\item
  z=0: free surface
\item
  z=-8: fixed in z-eirection
\item
  x=+8, -8, y = 8: roller
\item
  skin friction is modeled by placing an interface
  between pile concrete wall and clay.
  In it, fric angle of 20 and c=30kPa are assumed.
\item
  toe interface is placed between pile tip and clay
  \emph{note: Zone faces are separated in a previous command so that the gridpoints common to both will be separated as well.
  }note: include Figure of grid (geometry)

  1-2) wet density of clay is assigned below this water table.
\item
  equil. stress state after installation.
  2-1) change properties of pile zones from those
  representing clay to those representing concrete.
  2-2) vertical equil. stress distribution at this equil. state is shown in
  *note: include Figure of contours of vertical stress at ini state incld. pile weight
\item
  apply vertical velocity at top of pile
  ``ramp'' = boundary condition is increased linearly
  \emph{note: critical timestep is controlled by high stiffness of concrete
  If velocity is sudden, inertial effects will dominate and renders difficulty to identification of steady state response of system
  table ``ramp'' is used to apply velocity to pile top gridpoints.
  }note: FISH FUNCTION vert\_load calculates axial stress at the top of pile and stores value as a history
  For efficiency, gridpoints on cap surface are stored in symbol ``cap'' as a map
  \emph{note: include plot of axial stress vs axial displ. at pile toe. ramp = (0,5e-8), step number = 30000
  }note: combined damping is used to remove kinetic energy for prescribed loading condition. This is because mass-adjustment process depends on velocity sign-changes..
  \emph{note: FISH FUNCTION tot\_reac monitors soil reaction along pile as a func of lateral displ. tot\_reac creates tables of soil reaction (p) vs.~lateral displ (y) at diff. locations along pile to generate p-y curve.

this adds symmetric part
*note: The symmetry plane is a vertical plane (located by the dip, dip-direction, and origin keywords) coincident with the x = 0 plane. Note that dip angle (dip) and dip direction (dip-direction) assume that x corresponds to ``East,'' y to ``North'', and z to ``Up.''

third option, the zone gridpoint create command, is available to position single points in the model region.
*note: zone gridpoint create is used for positioning reference points of primitives

During execution of a zone create command, a check is made for each boundary gridpoint against the boundary gridpoints of zones that already exist.
If two boundary gridpoints fall within a tolerance of 1 ? 10-7 (relative to the magnitude of the gridpoints position vector) of each other, they are assumed to be the same point,
If it is discovered that some gridpoints don't match, the zone gridpoint merge command can be used to merge these gridpoints after the zone create command has been applied.

note that in the local z-direction, the maximum size length is 0.4. FLAC3D densifies the maximum length in this direction to be 1/3 (= 0.4)
The zone attach by-face command in this example is used to attach faces of sub-grids together rigidly to form a single grid

Always use the zone attach by-face command after the zone densify command if there are different numbers of gridpoints along faces of different zones.
